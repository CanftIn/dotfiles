Adds similar functionality as ~org-bullets~ and ~org-ellipsis~ to Emac's
~outline-mode~.

[[file:../../imgs/pretty-outlines.png]]

* Usage

Pretty-outlines is enabled by adding the appropriate hooks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package pretty-outlines
  :hook ((outline-mode       . pretty-outlines-set-display-table)
         (outline-minor-mode . pretty-outlines-set-display-table)
         (emacs-lisp-mode . pretty-outlines-add-bullets)
         (python-mode     . pretty-outlines-add-bullets)))
#+END_SRC

Requires ~outshine~, which is available on Melpa and can be setup with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package outshine
  :hook ((prog-mode          . outline-minor-mode)
         (outline-minor-mode . outshine-hook-function)))
#+END_SRC

Configure ~pretty-outlines-ellipsis~ and ~pretty-outlines-bullets-bullet-list~
to set your characters. Defaults to Org's defaults unless ~all-the-icons~ is
installed, then defaults to the screenshot.

This package is not yet uploaded to melpa. I intend to upload it along with my
other pretty packages soon.
